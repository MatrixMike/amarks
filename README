# amarks

note that this file name may look like it 'belongs' to a presenter
but was only copied from slides.  My working version does not have hyphens. I am attempting 
to re-introduce hyphens.
Also note that lein version for this test is 1.7.1 a.o.t. 2.6.x
Also note that lein clean does not (appear to) remove created jar file in root of lein project
